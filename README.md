# About
This is a base code for people who want to dip their toes into making their own responsive site, but feel overwhelmed.

## Customizable
This code can be customized and edited to your hearts desire, just make sure to credit me.

### Images
Easily swap between different icons, dividers, background, and sticker images. 
Make sure to look for <-- Text that looks like this --> 
or /* Text that looks like this */. 
The code beneath it can be easily altered.

## Main Content
There's JS that lets you go through each tab to input different 'pages.'

## Assets
All assets used are not mine.
Tiled background I got from [sadgrl online](https://sadgrl.online/)
Dividers and favicons found on [Gifcities](https://gifcities.org)
